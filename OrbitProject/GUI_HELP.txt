Hello.
As the programmer of this project i hope you a good time.
in the top menu bar you can see three options.
first option from left is for browsing into program options such as using a proxy with ip&port or setting redirection true and ...
the middle option is for toggling into FS or disable the left panel.
you can write your address with http|https(http prefferred) and select the request method and with the first menu in the 
center panel you can choose youre headers to send and with selecting body you can browse among the options available in the app
also note that before using urlencoded & formData the program asks you about your prefferred body type.
for activating a field to be send either in body or header or else you must ckeck the ckeckbox for the field to be enabled.
with trash icon you can smoothly delete the line fields next to it.
for the json body the indentation must be hold and you should write your body like : {a:b,c:d}
for selecting a binary file and uploading it please note that this app is not built for uploading huge files.
in the app you will see 3 fields in the right top corner that represents the recieved body size& connection time spent&
responseCode&message.
please email me your notes after using this app.
thank you. :)
